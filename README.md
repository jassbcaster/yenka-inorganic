# yenka-inorganic

This repository deals with the Inorganic Chemistry product of Yenka where I catalogue all of the reactions and reagents implemented in this pack\. This includes *separation techniques* to **isolate reagents** as well as **synthesizing new reagents** for use in further reactions\.

[Yenka](https://yenka.com) is a education modelling app in the subjects of mathematics, chemistry and physics\. It is primarily used as an education tool to introduce primary school students to these subjects in a "learn as you do" motif\. Despite certain limitations of an app intended for primary school education, several products of the app like the Inorganic Chemistry pack can be very powerful - there are advanced concepts in chemistry baked into the product which include complex redox reactions, transition metal complexes and residues of *organic chemistry* like the formation of **ethyl acetate**\.

If you have found an issue that needs correcting, please file an issue and specify exactly the problematic file(s), then detail the line number(s) of the erratic words, chemicals and/or equations\. Filing issues is the only method of contribution in this repository\.
